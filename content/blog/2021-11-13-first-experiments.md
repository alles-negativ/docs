After getting the printer to work as intended the first experiments were all around testing the capacities of the setup. What is possible as well as finding the right settings. Mainly a mix out of extrusion and flow rate combined with the layer hight. The result were simple shapes, generated during runtime. A good extrusion rate seam to be at around 8 percent of the distance made. A flow rate of 1500 looks to be a solid speed. The layer height does not matter that much. At around 0.5 it work quite well at the moment.
