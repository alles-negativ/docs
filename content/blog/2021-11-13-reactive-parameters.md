Since we now are able to create shapes and print data it starts to get more and more important to look at the parameters. Of course, the parameters are highly dependant on the involved functions. Nevertheless, one thing is for sure. the parameters need to be changed during a print. Is it by hand or by code? Therefore the next experiment was set up to test some changeable parameters. In a periodical manner, the setting of the print got updated and very geometrical and regular shapes were formed. Not very interesting and much sterile. So I decided to go one step further and start using real-time data from an API. The script maps the difference between two iterations and therefore creates an idea of how much change happened.
