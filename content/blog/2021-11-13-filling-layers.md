The next step was to shift the generated shapes from vase like shells towards a more filling thing. An obvious first experiment was to test a wave filling. Moving the toolpath from left to right while moving forward. It actually worked quite well, but is somehow limited to a rectangular shape. More complex geometrical forms would need some more consideration and algorithmic experimentation. However, filling and rotating layers worked as intended and created dense blocks of filament.
