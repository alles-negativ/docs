One of the important features is to create individual toolpaths. How does the line look like in the actual print? I implemented sine and triangle waveforms. Which I consider being the same with different settings. Square and saw waves. There is as well a last kind of wave which I called experimentally. It was in fact an attempt to create the saw shape with the help of Fourier transformations. It failed but is still an interesting addition to the collection. Some kind of dotted or interrupted lines would be nice as well but much more problematic to implement regarding the outflow of the filament. Slicer and shaper are working together smoothly at the moment and are as modular as they were intended to be. Multiple layers of wavy lines created noodle-like blobs. The outcome is still very hard to predict.
